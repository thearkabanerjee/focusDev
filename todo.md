so i have a few things in mind. 


i want to make a timer that appears on the right side of the screen in Visual Studio Code.

additionally i want to make a small run button something like that button that extensions like Code Runner offers. I also want to make it look a little bit different but that's something i can figure out later.

as of now i have the timer working but i want to make it look a little bit different.
I want to make it look like a gif running :

updates:
1. the GIF is running
2. everything is working well
3. but i still need to do a few things. 
    -- the work, break and session details are not updating with the change in settings
    -- i want to make a small settings button on some part and that will just take them to the settings of the extension instead of some `Cmd +Shift +P` / `Ctrl + Shift + P` thing


    -- I still want to have a button that will run the extension like code runner does and unlike that `Cmd + Shift + P` / `Ctrl + Shift + P` thing



as of now I have the timer working, these will be my goals for the next few days / maybe hours (if i feel like coding again)

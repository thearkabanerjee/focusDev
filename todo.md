so i have a few things in mind. 


i want to make a timer that appears on the right side of the screen in Visual Studio Code.

additionally i want to make a small run button something like that button that extensions like Code Runner offers. I also want to make it look a little bit different but that's something i can figure out later.

as of now i have the timer working but i want to make it look a little bit different.
I want to make it look like a gif running :
